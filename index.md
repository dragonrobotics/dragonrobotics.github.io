# Dragon Robotics Standards and Procedures

## Preface
This document is intended to be a living document and should be updated as new cases and situtations come to light.
Also, the first, and foremost rule surrounding this coding style document is:

**The rules are flexible, but don't be stupid.**

We can't think through every single possible scenario, and for every rule we come up with a hundred exceptions will inevitably
arise. On the other hand, however, each of these rules has a purpose.
If you need to break a rule, you'd better have a really good reason for it.
